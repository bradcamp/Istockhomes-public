# The Istockhomes Constitution
## Version 1.0 — Public, Copyable, Irrevocable

---

## Preamble
Istockhomes exists to enable real people to build real businesses around real assets, without permission, secrecy, or dependency.

There is nothing new under the sun.  
There is no competitive advantage in hiding.  
Authority comes from execution, not control.

This Constitution defines the unchangeable principles of Istockhomes.  
Anyone may copy it. Fork it. Build on it. Ignore it.  
It does not ask for agreement — only understanding.

## Closing Statement
Istockhomes is not here to replace platforms.  
It is here to make them optional.

Those who want control will hate it.  
Those who want freedom will use it.  
Those who want permission should look elsewhere.

This Constitution is public.  
This Constitution is final.  
This Constitution is already in effect.
