## 1. Purpose

This document defines how developers may participate in the Istockhomes platform.

It exists to:
- Enable developers to build and monetize client applications
- Protect the integrity of verification, reputation, and payments
- Clarify boundaries between client code and platform authority
- Explain how developers get paid without pay-to-play

Participation is open.  
Authority is centralized.  
Trust is enforced.

---

## 2. Who This Is For

This guide applies to developers who wish to:

- Build iOS, Android, or web client applications
- Create branded or white-labeled storefronts
- Skin or extend existing Istockhomes apps
- Distribute or sell their own versions of client software
- Participate in revenue generated by real transactions

This guide does **not** apply to:
- Advertisers
- Growth hackers
- Affiliate-only funnels
- Subscription-driven platforms
- Fake marketplaces or simulated inventory

---

## 3. Developer Role in the Ecosystem

Developers are **participants**, not vendors.

A developer may act as:
- A client app builder
- A UI/UX designer
- A platform integrator
- A long-term contributor

Developers do **not**:
- Control payments
- Control verification
- Control reputation
- Control enforcement
- Control platform rules

Client apps connect users to the Istockhomes platform.  
The platform governs outcomes.

---

## 4. What Developers Are Permitted To Do

Developers may:

- Download and use public Istockhomes client code
- Modify, fork, and extend client applications
- Rebrand and reskin applications for clients or markets
- Sell or distribute applications commercially
- Give applications away for free
- Build vertical-specific experiences (art, real estate, vehicles, rentals, etc.)
- Operate multiple branded deployments

There are no licensing fees to build or distribute client apps.

---

## 5. Mandatory Platform Conditions

The following conditions are required for all developer-built applications.

### 5.1 Verification Badge

All applications must:

- Display the **“Verified by Istockhomes”** badge or text
- Keep the badge visible within the user interface
- Ensure the badge is clickable
- Link to a live Istockhomes verification endpoint

Removing, disabling, obscuring, or falsifying verification invalidates trust.

---

### 5.2 Payments & Revenue Sharing

- All transactions route through Istockhomes-approved payment infrastructure
- Payment splitting is enforced server-side
- Developers may receive revenue automatically when configured
- The Istockhomes platform share is fixed and non-negotiable
- Client applications may not intercept, redirect, or modify payment flows

No participant is paid until:
- a real transaction occurs
- the buyer confirms completion
- verification succeeds

---

### 5.3 Identity & Reputation

- Identity is biometric-first (Face ID direction)
- Accounts are not identities
- Reputation is persistent and platform-wide
- Developers may not bypass, override, or reset reputation states

Abuse in one app affects access across the ecosystem.

---

## 6. Explicit Prohibitions

Developers may NOT:

- Remove or bypass verification mechanisms
- Handle payments outside approved flows
- Enable anonymous listing or purchasing
- Inject fake, simulated, or non-existent inventory
- Misrepresent ownership, availability, or delivery
- Clone or replace the Istockhomes backend or trust systems
- Present unverified entities as verified
- Use the platform for illegal goods or services

Violations are grounds for termination.

---

## 7. Secrets & Infrastructure

Client applications must **never** include:

- API keys
- Payment credentials
- Enforcement logic
- Trust or reputation algorithms

All sensitive systems are controlled by Istockhomes servers.

Client code is intentionally non-authoritative.

---

## 8. How Developers Get Paid

Developers do not charge users to participate.

Revenue occurs only when:
- a real asset is sold or booked
- the buyer confirms receipt or completion

At listing or setup time, payout emails may be defined for:
- Developer
- Pyramidion (sales operator / storefront)
- Creator / Asset owner
- Marketing or SEO partner (optional)
- Istockhomes (platform share)

Payments are automatic.  
There is no negotiation with buyers.  
There are no subscriptions.

---

## 9. Termination of Participation

Developer participation may be terminated if a developer:

- Violates trust rules
- Enables fraud or misrepresentation
- Attempts to bypass verification or payments
- Damages the integrity of the platform

Upon termination:
- Platform access is revoked
- Verification is removed
- Reputation consequences may apply

Client-side code remains the developer’s property.

---

## 10. Philosophy

Istockhomes is built on simple rules:

- Real assets only
- Real people only
- Real confirmation required
- Payment follows delivery
- Reputation has memory
- Consequences are permanent

Developers are invited to build **in reality**, not theater.
