Istockhomes Public Platform License

Version 1.0

Copyright © Istockhomes
All rights reserved where explicitly stated.

1. Purpose

This license governs the use of Istockhomes public repositories, including but not limited to:

Paruse (viewer applications)

Istockhomes client applications

UI, UX, and presentation-layer code

These repositories are published to demonstrate direction, enable participation, and allow developers to build value on top of the Istockhomes platform — not to replicate or extract it.

2. What You Are Allowed To Do

You are explicitly permitted to:

View, download, and run the source code

Modify, reskin, and adapt the user interface

Create white-label or branded versions

Distribute or sell applications built from this code

Use the code as a learning or starting point

Build commercial products that connect to Istockhomes

No royalties are required to use or distribute the client-side code itself.

3. Platform Participation & Revenue

Applications built using this code may connect to Istockhomes infrastructure.

When a transaction occurs through Istockhomes:

Payment distribution is handled automatically and server-side

Platform participation is non-negotiable

Client-side code does not control payouts

Developers, operators, creators, and contributors may participate
when properly registered to an entity before sales occur

The platform enforces a fixed participation layer.
The remaining value is defined by the creator and operator.

No client application may override, bypass, or redirect platform rules.

4. What Is Explicitly Excluded

This license does not grant access to:

Backend source code

Database schemas or credentials

Payment routing logic

Trust, payout, or governance logic

Admin or approval systems

Private APIs or infrastructure

“Inner core” systems or documentation

These systems are intentionally protected and are not open source.

5. Restrictions

You may not:

Replicate or reimplement Istockhomes backend systems

Create competing platforms using the same economic model

Circumvent or interfere with payment distribution

Misrepresent your application as the Istockhomes platform itself

Claim ownership of Istockhomes trademarks, names, or branding

Present yourself as part of the Istockhomes core team without approval

6. Trademarks & Naming

“Istockhomes” and associated marks are protected.

You may state that your application:

“Integrates with the Istockhomes platform”

You may not imply ownership, endorsement, or control unless explicitly authorized.

7. No Warranty

This software is provided as-is, without warranty of any kind.

Use of this code is at your own risk.

8. Philosophy (Non-Binding, But Intentional)

Istockhomes is built on the belief that:

Participation should be earned through contribution

Value should flow automatically

Systems should reduce friction, not create it

Trust scales better than contracts

Real assets deserve real infrastructure

If this license makes sense to you, you are likely aligned.

9. Questions & Alignment

If you wish to:

build deeper integrations
