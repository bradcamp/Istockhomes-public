## 1. Purpose

This document defines how money moves through the Istockhomes platform.

It explains:
- when payment occurs
- who gets paid
- how revenue is split
- what is fixed
- what is flexible
- why the model exists

Istockhomes economics are designed to:
- eliminate pay-to-play
- remove upfront fees
- reward real outcomes
- align creators, sellers, developers, and the platform

---

## 2. Core Economic Principle

**No transaction → no payment.**

There are:
- no listing fees
- no subscription fees
- no access fees
- no “boost” fees
- no paywalls

Money only moves when **something real is sold, booked, or delivered**.

---

## 3. Platform Share

Istockhomes retains a **fixed platform share** on all completed transactions.

- The platform share is currently **10%**
- This percentage is:
  - enforced server-side
  - non-negotiable
  - immutable at transaction time

The platform share funds:
- infrastructure
- verification
- reputation enforcement
- payment routing
- fraud prevention
- platform development

Istockhomes earns nothing if nothing real happens.

---

## 4. The Remaining Share (90%)

The remaining **90%** of a transaction is distributed among participants who created value.

This portion is **flexible** and **configurable**, depending on asset type and agreement.

Typical participants include:
- Asset owner / creator
- Pyramidion (sales operator / storefront)
- Developer
- Marketing or SEO partner (optional)

Istockhomes does not dictate how the 90% is split.

---

## 5. Example Splits (Non-Binding)

The following examples illustrate common use cases.  
Actual splits are defined at listing or setup time.

---

### 5.1 Artwork (Gallery Model)

- Istockhomes: 10%
- Artist: 45%
- Gallery / Pyramidion: 45%

This mirrors traditional gallery economics, with automated enforcement.

---

### 5.2 Real Estate (Typical Market)

- Istockhomes: 10%
- Real Estate Agent / Pyramidion: 7%
- Homeowner: 83%

No upfront listing fee.  
No payment unless the home sells.

---

### 5.3 Vehicle or Asset Sale

- Istockhomes: 10%
- Asset Owner: 70%
- Pyramidion: 10%
- Developer: 10%

Developers earn because their software enabled the sale.

---

### 5.4 Rentals / Charters (Yachts, Aircraft, Events)

- Istockhomes: 10%
- Asset Owner / Operator: 60–75%
- Pyramidion: 10–20%
- Developer / Marketing: remainder

Exact splits are set per listing or agreement.

---

## 6. Developer Participation in Economics

Developers are **not paid upfront** and **do not charge users**.

Developers earn by:
- enabling transactions
- providing distribution
- improving conversion
- maintaining usable interfaces

Developers may:
- receive a percentage of completed transactions
- earn passively over time
- participate in multiple entities or brands

Payment is automatic when configured.

---

## 7. Pyramidions (Sales Operators)

Pyramidions are salespeople.

They may be:
- storefront owners
- brokers
- curators
- marketers
- regional operators

Pyramidions:
- do not pay to join
- do not pay to list
- earn only when sales occur

Their reputation compounds across the platform.

---

## 8. Buyer Confirmation Requirement

No payment is released until:

1. The transaction occurs
2. The buyer confirms delivery or completion
3. Confirmation is recorded via biometric intent

This protects:
- buyers
- sellers
- developers
- the platform

No confirmation → no payout.

---

## 9. Payment Infrastructure

Payments are handled via:
- Istockhomes-approved payment processors
- automated split payment logic
- server-side enforcement

Client applications:
- never hold payment keys
- never calculate splits
- never release funds

---

## 10. Economic Abuse

The following are prohibited:

- Fake listings
- Dead inventory
- Self-dealing
- Wash transactions
- Payment manipulation
- Circumventing confirmation

Abuse results in:
- frozen payouts
- reputation damage
- platform-wide exclusion

---

## 11. Why This Model Exists

Traditional models fail because:
- people pay before earning
- platforms profit without delivery
- salespeople carry all the risk
- creators are underpaid
- software extracts rent

Istockhomes reverses this:

- free to build
- free to list
- free to sell
- payment only after reality

---

## 12. Summary

- No upfront costs
- No subscriptions
- No fake volume
- No payment without delivery
- Fixed platform share
- Flexible participant splits
- Automated enforcement
- Reputation-backed economics

---

**If value is created, everyone gets paid.  
If nothing real happens, nobody does.**
