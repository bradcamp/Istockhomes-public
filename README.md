Public overview of the Istockhomes platform, architecture philosophy, and developer participation model.
# Istockhomes — Public Overview

This repository provides a **public-facing overview** of the Istockhomes platform.

It exists to explain *how we think*, *what we are building*, and *how developers may participate* — without exposing proprietary systems or implementation details.

---

## What Istockhomes is

Istockhomes is a long-term platform designed to surface **real value in the physical world**.

That includes:
- homes and real estate
- artwork and one-of-a-kind creations
- businesses and inventory
- trades and services
- high-value assets (marine, aviation, equipment)

The platform is mobile-first, AI-assisted, and built to feel calm and human — even when the infrastructure behind it is complex.

---

## How the platform works (high level)

At its simplest, a listing can begin with a photo.

From there, the system handles:
- intelligent categorization
- guided listing creation
- trust and identity enforcement
- automated revenue distribution
- long-term durability of content

Modern phone capabilities (camera, location, biometrics) are used naturally rather than forced.

---

## Economic model (intentionally simple)

All transactions on Istockhomes follow a **90 / 10 rule**.

- 90% goes to the people who create and surface value
- 10% supports the Istockhomes ecosystem

Splits inside the 90% follow familiar industry norms and are chosen at the listing level.

Developers who help build revenue-generating systems may participate through **automatic revenue sharing**, not billing or time tracking.

---

## Entities, not jobs

Istockhomes is built around **entities**, not employment.

Entities are branded digital portals that can be:
- developed
- operated
- leased
- renewed
- sold

Developers may support one or more entities behind the scenes.
Others operate them forward-facing as trust anchors.

Participation grows through alignment and trust, not contracts alone.

---

## What this repository is not

This repository does not contain:
- production code
- payment logic
- identity systems
- AI orchestration
- proprietary infrastructure

Those systems are intentionally protected.

## How to learn more

If this resonates, the next step is not a pull request.

Start here:

That page explains what we are building and how participation works.

## Final note

Istockhomes is being built deliberately, quietly, and for the long term.

We value clarity over speed, trust over access, and systems that compound over time.
